# wordbag
Part of Solium's monthly programming competition
Like peasants digging in the filth, your job this competition is to write a program that, when given a collection of letters, will find all of the words it can make with that collection.
So given:
-  dictionary of words (use W on linux) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_(Unix)
        You may use a file containing a list of words in the English language, separated by new lines. It should be called W and will be located in the same directory as your program. (On GNU/Linux systems and possibly others, you can make W a link to /usr/share/dict/words). You can also choose a restricted subset of words as well and include the file in your submission.
- collection of letters (a letter can appear more than once)

Output:
    A list of words that can be produced from those letters (not all letters must be used)

Example:
$ wordbag < eratg

Output:
great
grate
rate
rat
tag
are
eat
gear

(there's probably more)
